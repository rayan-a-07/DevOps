<ul>
  <li>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</li>
  <li>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</li>
  <li>Configuration Management</li>
  <li>Monitoring and Logging</li>
  <li>Containerization and Orchestration</li>
  <li>Cloud Computing</li>
</ul>

# Tools
Here, I'll keep track of the various tools I'm using or experimenting with in my DevOps journey. You'll find detailed information about their features, use cases, and installation guides. Additionally, I'll include sample configurations, scripts, and notes on how I've been utilizing these tools.

# Projects
This section will showcase the hands-on projects I've undertaken to apply my DevOps knowledge in practical scenarios. These projects will cover different domains and complexity levels, allowing me to continuously challenge myself and solidify my understanding.

# Learning Resources
In this section, I'll maintain a curated list of learning resources that have been particularly helpful in my DevOps journey. This includes books, online courses, blogs, and other valuable references that have aided my understanding and skill development.

# Contributing
While this repository primarily serves as a personal learning and sharing platform, I welcome contributions from others in the form of suggestions, improvements, or additional resources. If you have something to share or contribute, please follow the guidelines in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
